# AMVAR
Adaptive Multivariate AutoRegregression for spectral analysis
- an alternative to Fourier analysis as it allows for BOTH, high spectral AND temporal resolution
- particularly useful when many multiple trials are present
- implemented using the least-squares method
- allows to calculate the following spectral quantities: power, coherence, partial coherence, coherence phase, phase of partial coherence, multiple coherence
- for further information on the method see e.g.:
